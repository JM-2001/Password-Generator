## About
This project was created to demonstrate the skills that I've obtained throughout the year. Besides this, the website was created to allow users to generate a password depending on options they pick. The home page explains why password security is important. 

## Usage
To use the website, you can clone this repo to your local machine and run the html using a browser. Alternatively, users can use <a href="https://echoblu.github.io/Password-Generator/" target="_blank">Live Preview</a> to view the webpage.
