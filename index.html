                    <h2>Information about Password Security</h2>
                    <ul id="listMain">
                        <li>
                            Why is it important?
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Password Security is important because it is the key to protecting your accounts from malicious actors. 
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How can you improve your password security?
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Never use your passwords more than once. If there's a password breach in any of your accounts, the malicious
                                    actors can't use that breached password to access your other accounts. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Never use common passwords or easy-to-guess passwords.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Don't use passwords that can be guessed using information from your social media accounts.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Don't use words or phrases in your passwords. In addition, don't create passwords with numbers or special characters
                                    that resemble words or phrases. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Create complex passwords with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters to increase the strength of the
                                    password. This can be done by yourself or using password generators.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Use Multi-Factor Authentication(MFA) or 2-Factor Authentication(2FA).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Use a password manager to save and store your passwords. Although writing your passwords down isn't suggested, 
                                    you can write them down BUT they should be kept in a safe location. 
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Is there a way to check if your passwords have been leaked?
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Yes, you can use the website <em><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haveibeenpwned.com</a></em> to check
                                    if your accounts have been compromised.
